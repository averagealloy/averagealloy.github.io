DISCLAIMER: I finishing up the the full time online software engineering program so take it for what its worth. disclamer over.

# What do you get? 
For starters when you sign up to go to a coding bootcap there is a curriculum you look at it not knowing what any of it is and you glance at it with your big brain and say "ahhhhhh this seems reasonable and cool!". So you sign up. You take the first step to changing your life. Through out the school's term or how ever long you will be working through the course work you will learn about different languages, frameworks and libraries flexing your brain aound concepts that were inconcevible at the start of your coding journey.


#  Coaches, Coaches, Coaches

A huge part of coming to the flatiron school is the support staff. There are three parts to this triangle. The one you have the most contact with on a day to day basis your Tech Coach. The Tech Coach will aid you when you get stuck on a problem or you are just looking for claity on a specfic topic. Being new at this it happens a lot, its ok. You are trying to learn a brand new language to communicate with a machine.

The next coach that you will be talking with is your Non-Technical Coach. You will meet your Non-Technical Coach in orientation during your first week. Following that you will have meeting more sporadically. the Goal with the Non-Technical Coach is to keep you on the right track mentally. Makeing sure you are motivated to continue on your journey. The biggest role that I believe that the Non-Technical Coach plays in how to navigate the pit of dispair. The pit of dispair happens and how to escape it is important and the Non-Technical Coach helps you with that.

The final coach that you will be talking with is your Career Coach. The Career Coach will help you make the transition to the work force. I have only talked with my Career Coach a little bit so I am not comfortable diving into it fully. But, you should stick around for the update blog! where I will go into it  further!



# The intangibles

There are alot of things you can read online about bootcamps and what they offer. But, I have noticed some things that haven't been talked about. The first thing that comes to mind is the people you work with. Now I am not talking about the coaches. I'm talking about the people when its project week and you've rewritten you schema 7 different times over the cource of the weekend you call on. The people who sacrifice there time and effort to help you find a spelling error in a file that you wrote a week ago, the people who you can go to when it's 10 minutes before your review when you are feaking out to calm you down. These people that I am describing is the exactly where the value is. (for me at least)

# So now what?

Congrats, you have read this whole blog. I hope you have enjoyed reading about my experenice at The FlatIron school. If you are curious about going to a bootcamp. I would encourage you check out the bootcamp you wanna go to and talk to the almuni. Thats the best way to get a feel for what you are getting into. 

Good Luck
