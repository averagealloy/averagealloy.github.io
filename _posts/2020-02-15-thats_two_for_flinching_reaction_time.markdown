When I had got to the React portion of the curriculum I didn't really see a purpose. We have our backend with a Rails api and we have our front end with JavaScript. So being the brillant and smart person I am, I ignored it, thinking it will come later. In Isolation I knew what a componenet is and how they should look but, my brother asked what does React do and I didnt have an answer for him. so what I am going to do in this blog is try to explain who made React, what is it and why you would use it in an application!


# Who made React?

Everything in my life time has been made by someone or a group of someone's React included. React came about from the fine folks at Facebook in the year 2016. I know it's not in the intro paragraph but it was made by a human by the name of Jordan Walke. I am sure that there was a ton of other people who had worked (and are still working on) React but in my googling that name was came up alot as the big tortuga for the project.

# What is React?
Alright, lets get down to brass tax here. What is React? Well alot of people think that react is a frame work for JavaScript (me included) . React is a library for Javascript to build fast user interfaces. But Mike that really doesn't help me when it fits in and dont worry I said the same thing. Here is how it fits in my weird brain, we still need something to manipulate and store the data and that would be the backend. In this case it would be our Rails API. Do you remember in my example eariler I was talking about the JavaScript from end were still using it but instead of regular JS were just using a different libaray.

# A better anology for more understanding.
Who doesn't like Ice cream? Think of JavaScript like a flavor the base version of JS would be vanilla. But then, what would React be? Well I like to think of React like cherry sherbet. It fits a specfic catagory of desert what if you dont do well with dairy. You can get something that fit your specfic needs. Now, when you walk out of the shop you can say "yes, I got some desert" but what they dont know is that you got somthing that works best for you!


# In what scenario would you use React?

So what case are you gonna get cherry sherbet?? Well it comes down to what you are making. Is it a web or a mobile app? I have seen some projects profesional and other wise that look incredible because of React. Another great reason to use React is that it is lightweight. there is not alot of fluff with React. A Huge plus with React is the documentation, as a new developer this is awesome to see. Its not just some html with css styling these people put in the hours to make what they put out into the world look great and ease of use is at an all time high. My final and last point with using React is that it is fun. Just plain and simple. Seeing all the changes that you have made in the virtual DOM is electric. Showing you right in front of you face that you have impact with every keystroke it a great time!


# Wrap Up

I hope that with this little blog that you have a bit more insight into the world of React. This should give you a nice little intro on where to start with this stuff. If you take away nothing from this blog just look at the React logo it's pretty cool!
